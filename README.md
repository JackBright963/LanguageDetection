# LanguageDetection
This is a simple machine learning model that uses Na√Øve Bayes algorithm to detect the language of a user's input.
The model performs wells, but it only detects the 17 languages mentioned in the dataset. If the model is trained on a dataset with more languages available, then it weill be able to detect them as well.
